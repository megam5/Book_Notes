# [Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_to_One) book by [PETER THIEL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel) with Blake Masters

The repository consists of the notes from the book.

## Notes

The prime idea behind Zero to One is that it’s really important to focus on things that create something new that is, going from 0 to 1 instead of copying things that are going from 1 to n. Zero to One is about Peter Thiel's experience on how to create companies that create new things. He learned all these things directly as a co-founder of [Paypal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal) and [Palantir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palantir_Technologies) and also from hundreds of other startups, including [SpaceX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX) and [Facebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook). The book is the result of detailed class notes took by Blake Masters when Peter Thiel taught a lesson at [Stanford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University) in 2012. Peter Thiel worked with Blake Masters to revise the notes for a wider audience. According to him, the single most powerful pattern he noticed is that successful people find value in unexpected places.

As every moment in business happens only once. Copying means you aren't learning anything. The next [Bill Gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates) won't create an Operating System and the next [Mark Zuckerberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg) won't create a social network. Thus, 0 to 1 that is vertical progress is difficult to predict as it involves someone doing something never done before. Thiel identifies this vertical form of progress as technology, whereas the horizontal progress of taking something that works, copying it and making it work everywhere is simply globalization. Successful technology businesses often lose money initially but over time something valuable is built. Thiel explains that the current value of a business is the total amount of money it will make in the future.

The author also has 3 core beliefs that form the backbone of his prescription for success.
1) Globalization is doomed without technological innovation.
2) Capitalism is the opposite of competition.
3) We can shape our future.

Brand new technology often comes from small groups of people in start-ups. Bureaucracy in large companies makes developing new technology slow and difficult. To succeed in something you need to create a monopoly (exclusive control of a commodity or service in a market). WHY MONOPOLY? Because Capitalism and Competition are opposites. Capitalism is all about generating profits whereas competition eliminates profits. Competition is all about lower prices and margins. In a perfect competition where supply meets the demand from the consumer, no business would make an economic profit in the long term as if there was profit to be made, new companies would enter the market, increase supply and drive prices down. In contrast, monopolies enjoy high profits. A monopoly, can set its price and makes more profit. Google is an example of a business that went from 0 to 1 and is now a monopoly, at least in search engine with 68% of the market.

Sometimes competition and rivals are inevitable and if you can’t beat your rival you may do better to merge with them. That’s what Thiel did when his company PayPal joined [Elon Musk’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk) [X.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.com) in a 50-50 split. This allowed them to survive the dot-com bust and build a successful company.

##### How to create and maintain such a monopoly?
It all starts with us. The author has a belief that success is not a matter of luck. If you think your future is ruled by luck, you have to be ready for anything. Our entire system is built on this premise which means this works in fields like education and even in skills also. In high school, you spent the same time on each skill, the same thing happens in college. We are rewarded for knowing just enough of everything. The result? You’ll be average at everything and good at nothing. Instead of taking this approach you can shape your future by thinking about your next steps and taking the time to plan. YOU ARE NOT A LOTTERY TICKET. Getting laser-like focus early on can help you develop outstanding skills and maybe then you can come up with a 0 to 1 solution we so desperately need. First, develop a 0 to 1 type offering for a niche market and then scale up. You need to come up with a product or service solution that delivers a 10x speed, performance, or convenience benefits.

##### Protect the monopoly
After all this work, you’re still not finished because a monopoly isn’t worth much unless it can be protected. You can maintain your monopoly through proprietary technology, network effects, economies of scale, and branding.

###### 1 Proprietary Technology:
Proprietary technology is the most substantive advantage a company can have because it makes your product difficult or impossible to replicate. Google’s search algorithms, for example, return results better than anyone else’s. As a good rule of thumb, proprietary technology must be at least 10 times better than its closest substitute in some important dimension to lead to a real monopolistic advantage.
###### 2 Network Effects:
Network effects make a product more useful as more people use it. Making it more difficult for someone to compete with you.  For example, if all your friends are on Facebook, it makes sense for you to join Facebook, too. Successful network businesses rarely get started by MBA types: the initial markets are so small that they often don’t even appear to be business opportunities at all.
###### 3 Economies of Scale:
A monopoly business gets stronger as it gets bigger. The larger your volume the lower your average cost because of high fixed costs making it difficult for your competitor to generate any profits. Software startups can enjoy especially dramatic economies of scale because the marginal cost of producing another copy of the product is close to zero. Twitter already has more than 250 million users today. It doesn’t need to add too many customized features to acquire more, and there’s no inherent reason why it should ever stop growing.
###### 4 Branding:
A company has a monopoly on its own brand by definition, so creating a strong brand is a powerful way to claim a monopoly. Today’s strongest tech brand is Apple. Beginning with a brand rather than a substance is dangerous. When Steve Jobs returned to Apple, he didn’t just make Apple a cool place to work; he slashed product lines to focus on the handful of opportunities for 10x improvements. No technology company can be built on branding alone.

##### How do 'YOU' go about building a monopoly?
Brand, scale, network effects, and technology in some combination define a monopoly; but to get them to work, you need to choose your market carefully and expand deliberately.

###### 1 Start Small and Monopolize:
Every startup is small at the start. Every monopoly dominates a large share of its market. Therefore, every startup should start with a very small market. The reason is simple: it’s easier to dominate a small market than a large one.

###### 2 Scaling Up:
Once you create and dominate a niche market, then you should gradually expand into related and slightly broader markets. Amazon shows how it can be done. Jeff Bezos’s founding vision was to dominate all of online retail, but he very deliberately started with books. Amazon then had two options: expand the number of people who read books, or expand to adjacent markets. They chose the latter, starting with the most similar markets: CDs, videos, and software.

###### 3 Don’t Disrupt:
Silicon Valley has become obsessed with “disruption.” Originally, “disruption” was a term of art to describe how a firm can use new technology to introduce a low-end product at low prices, improve the product over time and eventually overtake even the premium products offered by incumbent companies using older technology. This is roughly what happened when the advent of PCs disrupted the market for mainframe computers: at first, PCs seemed irrelevant, then they became dominant. Today mobile devices may be doing the same thing to PCs.

As the author says, EVEN A BAD PLAN IS BETTER THAN NO PLAN. Perhaps not the most optimistic conclusion but it's encouraging to plan ahead. Every current well-known idea was once not known. It was at one point, a secret. A valuable company that has not been built yet is also, therefore, a secret. Believing in secrets allows you to achieve something hard that many people would believe is impossible. There are many more secrets left to find, but only by people who constantly look for them. Diseases are still to be cured, speed of travel can be increased and business start-ups can use spare capacity that is ignored. Airbnb and Uber are recent examples of this, connecting suppliers to demand and finding the secret hidden in plain sight.

So what should a company get right at the beginning to ensure it’s not flawed from the start? The most crucial decision is picking the right co-founder, although making sure everyone in the company gets along is essential too. Founders should know each other well before starting the company, otherwise, it’s like marrying the first person you meet – it may work, but it’s unlikely. As a rule, everyone should work fulltime in the company with an odd exception such as an accountant. Also working remotely should be avoided. This keeps everyone together and on the same page, preventing misalignment. Thiel has spotted that the less a CEO is paid, the better the company does when it’s a start-up. The lower pay will incentivize the focus of building up the value of the company in total. The low pay also sets a standard for other employees.

##### Distribution
The importance of distribution, i.e. everything to do with selling a product is underestimated according to Thiel. Customers will not just appear because you’ve built something, selling it is something you need to do too. Advertising works and therefore matters. We may resist obvious sales pitches and believe advertising doesn’t work on us, but that is false confidence. Advertising can embed subtle impressions on our minds that can drive sales later. Bad salesmen, we react negatively to, sales experts we may not even know because their work is hidden in plain sight. When hidden, sales work best. Even job titles hide what people do: People who sell advertising are Account executive People who sell customers are Business developers. People who sell companies are Investment bankers. People who sell themselves are Politicians. The main reason people underestimate the importance of sales is that it is hidden. Ultimately every business must try to answer seven questions. Peter Thiel’s seven questions are:

1) `Engineering –` can you create breakthrough technology instead of incremental improvements?
2) `Timing –` is now the right time to start your particular business?
3) `Monopoly –` are you starting with a big share of a small market?
4) `People –` do you have the right team?
5) `Distribution –` do you have a way to not just create but deliver your product?
6) `Durability –` will your market position be defensible ten or twenty years into the future?
7) `Secret –` have you identified a unique opportunity that others don’t see?

Without a good answer to all of them, the business may fail. It may succeed with five or six answers, but correctly answering all seven will lead to success.
